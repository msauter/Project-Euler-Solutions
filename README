This project is a collection of solutions to the programming problems on 
projecteuler.net.  The problem I'm solving in each script is included in a 
comment at the top of each solution file.  I wrote these solutions because 
I wanted to learn more about programming in Python.  Additionally I like 
solving math problems, and I found the math based problems on the site were 
a good way to keep me interested as I learned.  I kept at it because the 
feedback you get for making progress is addictive, in the same way I think 
a lot of online games are.

I'm proud of it not so much for any individual solution but more for the 
whole body of 46 solved problems.  When I made it to 25 solutions, a pop-up 
on the site told me I was in the top 20% or so of people on the site in 
terms of problems solved.  Now that I've solved closer to 50 I'd imagine 
I'm in an even higher percentile.  I'm proud of that accomplishment and 
have learned a lot through the experience.
